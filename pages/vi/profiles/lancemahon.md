## About Me
I am an aspiring software developer and expert cat father. I enjoy learning new things and have been interested in software for four years.
I took computer science courses in college as well as some philosophy because I enjoy the abstract reasoning involved in both disciplines. 

I always enjoy a good D&D game or Sci-Fi TV show or book. I'm looking for recommendations so let me know what you're watching/reading!
